# Structural Ontology of Law (SOoL)

This repository contains the **Structural Ontology of Law (SOoL)** and its associated tools, diagrams, and ontological artifacts. SOoL is a realist, structural framework for understanding law as a system of relations, roles, obligations, and institutional processes rather than merely a collection of rules or norms.

The materials here support research, teaching, and computational modeling of legal systems, and serve as the technical companion to the book project *The Architecture of Justice / The Ontology of Law*.

---

## Purpose

SOoL provides:

- A **formal ontology of law** grounded in Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
- A **structural account of legal obligation, authority, and contradiction**
- Visual and computational tools for analyzing legal coherence and failure
- A foundation for **IRAC+**, contradiction diagnostics, and computable legal reasoning

The aim is not to replace doctrine or jurisprudence, but to make the *structure* of legal systems explicit, inspectable, and testable.
