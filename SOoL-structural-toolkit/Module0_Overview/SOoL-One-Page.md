# Structural Ontology of Law (SOoL) — At a Glance

## What SOoL Is
SOoL is a **structural theory of law**.  It explains legality in terms of roles, relations, authority, processes and institutional recognition rather than purely normative rules.  It posits that law succeeds or fails **structurally**, not merely normatively.

## The Core Insight
A legal outcome exists **only if a complete structural chain is satisfied**.  If any link is missing, distorted, or mis‑aligned, the result is a **legal contradiction** rather than merely a legal error.

## The Minimum Legal Chain (MLC)
A valid legal effect requires the following eight links:

1. **Source of Authority** – A recognised authority capable of conferring power.
2. **Jurisdictional Scope** – Spatial, temporal and subject‑matter limits of authority.
3. **Role Conferral** – An agent occupies a legally recognised role.
4. **Normative Content** – Obligations, permissions, or powers attached to the role.
5. **Authorised Process** – Actions taken according to required procedures.
6. **Legal Event** – A legally significant act or occurrence.
7. **Recognition / Recording** – Institutional uptake of the event as legally effective.
8. **Remedy / Repair** – Mechanisms to correct, reverse, or enforce outcomes.

## Structural Failure = Legal Contradiction
When the MLC fails, the failure is **classifiable**.  Authority failures, jurisdictional contradictions, procedural defects, recognition failures and repair breakdowns are not “edge cases” – they constitute the **architecture of legal breakdown**.

## The SOoL Pipeline
**Ontology → Minimum Legal Chain → Contradiction Diagnosis → IRAC+**

Facts become law only after passing through structure.  You cannot reason legally about what has not been structurally grounded.

## What SOoL Enables
* **For students** – a stable diagnostic method across all subjects
* **For faculty** – a unified teaching framework
* **For researchers** – a BFO‑aligned structural layer
* **For AI systems** – legal reasoning without hallucinated structure
* **For practitioners** – faster, disciplined issue analysis
