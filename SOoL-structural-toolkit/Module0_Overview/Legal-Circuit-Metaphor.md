# The Legal Circuit Metaphor

Law can be understood as a **circuit**: a legal effect is like electricity that flows when the circuit is complete.  Each component of the circuit has a structural analogue in law:

| Circuit component | Legal analogue |
| --- | --- |
| **Battery** | Source of authority — the power that energises the system. |
| **Switch** | Role conferral — whether the actor is placed in the legally recognised role. |
| **Wire** | Authorised process — the procedure that connects events and effects. |
| **Bulb** | Legal effect — the illumination that occurs when the circuit is complete. |
| **Fuse** | Remedy/repair — the safeguard that prevents harm and allows repair. |

Just as an electrical circuit will not light the bulb if a wire is cut or the switch is broken, **a legal effect does not arise if any link in the Minimum Legal Chain is missing or defective**.  The metaphor makes structural failure intuitive:

- **No battery → no authority**
- **Broken switch → invalid role conferral**
- **Cut wire → procedural defect**
- **Burnt bulb → no legal effect**
- **Missing fuse → no remedy**

This circuit metaphor helps students and practitioners grasp why authorised actors, proper procedures, and institutional recognition are necessary for legality.
