# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary provides both plain‑language and formal definitions for the core concepts used throughout the Structural Ontology of Law.

## Authority
- **Plain‑language definition:** The legally recognised capacity to create binding effects.
- **Formal definition:** A role‑grounded power that is dependent on institutional recognition; a generically dependent continuant in BFO terms【873523715407077†L155-L159】.

## Jurisdiction
- **Plain‑language definition:** The limits within which authority may be exercised (spatial, temporal or subject‑matter).
- **Formal definition:** Constraints on role realisation across space, time and subject matter; often modelled as relational dependent continuants.

## Role
- **Plain‑language definition:** A legally recognised position an agent occupies (e.g., judge, police officer, party).
- **Formal definition:** A specifically dependent continuant that inheres in an agent and is realised by institutional processes; it may be understood through the BFO distinction between continuants and occurrents【516386639202089†L88-L97】.

## Norm
- **Plain‑language definition:** An obligation, permission or power attached to a role.
- **Formal definition:** A realisable dependent continuant that prescribes or permits behaviour; typically connected to roles through conferral relations.

## Authorised Process
- **Plain‑language definition:** The procedure an agent must follow to realise legal effects.
- **Formal definition:** An occurrent (process) defined by norms and roles; in BFO, a legal process is an occurrent that instantiates the powers attached to a role【516386639202089†L90-L97】.

## Legal Event
- **Plain‑language definition:** An act or occurrence that has legal significance (e.g., signing a contract, issuing a citation).
- **Formal definition:** An occurrent recognised by an institution as having legal effect; it participates in the chain that realises norms.

## Recognition
- **Plain‑language definition:** Institutional acknowledgement that a legal event has occurred and produces binding effects.
- **Formal definition:** A constitutive act by an institution, often modelled as the creation of a new realisable dependent continuant.

## Remedy
- **Plain‑language definition:** A means to correct, enforce or reverse legal effects.
- **Formal definition:** An institutional process or disposition aimed at restoring structural coherence; a remedy may be a process or a disposition in BFO terms.

## Legal Contradiction
- **Plain‑language definition:** A structural failure in the legal chain that prevents legality (e.g., absence of authority, misaligned jurisdiction, missing recognition).
- **Formal definition:** An inconsistency or absence within the Minimum Legal Chain; violations of BFO-typed constraints at any link produce ontological failure【873523715407077†L155-L159】.
