# Structural Reasoning Labs

These laboratory exercises allow students to apply the SOoL structural model to concrete scenarios.  Each lab is designed for a 90‑minute session.

## Lab 1 – Building the Minimum Legal Chain

1. **Objective:**  Construct an MLC record for a simple fact pattern (e.g., issuance of a parking ticket).
2. **Materials:**  Fact pattern handout, MLC schema, blank chain template.
3. **Procedure:**  
   - Read the fact pattern.  
   - Identify the authority, jurisdiction, roles, norms, process, event, recognition and remedy.  
   - Document each link in the chain.  
   - Discuss with peers and compare chains.
4. **Outcome:**  Completed MLC record and understanding of how each link is instantiated.

## Lab 2 – Contradiction Diagnosis

1. **Objective:**  Detect structural failures in a complex scenario (e.g., an unauthorised eviction).  
2. **Procedure:**  
   - Build the MLC for the scenario.  
   - Evaluate each link for validity.  
   - Identify which contradiction type(s) occur.  
   - Discuss possible remedies.
3. **Outcome:**  Students produce a contradiction report using the Structural Integrity Report template.

## Lab 3 – BFO Typing

1. **Objective:**  Practise mapping legal concepts to BFO categories.  
2. **Procedure:**  
   - Provide a list of legal terms.  
   - Students assign each term to a BFO class.  
   - Discuss ambiguous cases and justify choices.
3. **Outcome:**  Improved familiarity with BFO categories and their application in law.

## Lab 4 – IRACplus Writing

1. **Objective:**  Compose an IRACplus analysis based on a structural diagnosis.  
2. **Procedure:**  
   - Use a scenario with known structural failures.  
   - Students write the Issue, Rule, Analysis and Conclusion sections.  
   - Include a structural diagnosis header.  
   - Peer‑review the write‑ups.
3. **Outcome:**  Students connect structural reasoning to persuasive legal writing.
