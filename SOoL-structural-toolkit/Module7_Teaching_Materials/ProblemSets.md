# Problem Sets

## Problem 1: Authority and Jurisdiction

*Facts:*  A city council passes a regulation prohibiting drones in public parks.  The mayor’s office issues fines for violations in private backyards.

1. Build the MLC for the mayor’s enforcement action.
2. Identify which link(s) in the chain fail.
3. Classify the contradiction(s).
4. Propose a remedy.

## Problem 2: Role Conferral

*Facts:*  An employee of a corporation signs a multimillion‑dollar contract without being authorised by the board.  The employee’s job title is “intern.”

1. Which MLC link is likely to fail?  Explain why.
2. What BFO category is violated?
3. How would this affect the validity of the contract?

## Problem 3: Procedural and Temporal Issues

*Facts:*  A statute requires that a notice be filed within 30 days of an administrative decision for an appeal to be valid.  The notice is filed on day 45 due to postal delays.

1. Build the MLC and indicate which link is affected.
2. Identify the contradiction type.
3. Are there any remedies?  If so, which link do they correspond to?

## Problem 4: Recognition Failure

*Facts:*  Parties enter into a private agreement to sell land.  The agreement is never recorded.  The buyer later seeks to enforce the agreement against a subsequent bona fide purchaser.

1. How does the absence of recording affect the MLC?  
2. Which contradiction type arises?  
3. Discuss the policy reasons behind the recording requirement.

## Problem 5: Institutionalised Contradiction

*Facts:*  In practice, the police routinely stop and search vehicles without probable cause, and courts admit the evidence despite statutory protections.  This practice is widely known but rarely challenged.

1. Identify the structural failures present.  
2. Does this constitute a Type 13 Institutionalised Contradiction?  Why or why not?  
3. How could the system restore structural integrity?
