# Circuit Metaphor Worksheet

This worksheet helps students internalise the legal circuit metaphor by matching electrical components to legal analogues.

## Part A – Matching

Match each circuit component to its legal analogue:

| Circuit Component | Legal Analogue | Student Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Battery | | |
| Switch | | |
| Wire | | |
| Bulb | | |
| Fuse | | |

## Part B – Scenario Analysis

Consider the following scenario: An unauthorised employee (without proper delegation) signs a contract outside the company’s geographic area.  Identify which circuit components are present and which are missing or defective.  Explain your reasoning.

## Part C – Design Your Own Circuit

Choose a legal scenario (e.g., issuing a marriage licence, arresting a suspect, enforcing a court order).  Draw a simple circuit diagram with a battery, switch, wires, bulb and fuse.  Label each component with its legal analogue and describe what happens if a component fails.
