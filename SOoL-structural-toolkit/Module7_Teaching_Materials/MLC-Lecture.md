# Teaching Module: Minimum Legal Chain (MLC)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Explain the eight links of the Minimum Legal Chain (MLC) and their BFO categories.
- Identify which structural link applies to a given legal problem.
- Diagnose structural failures and classify them according to the contradiction typology.

## Overview

The MLC is a diagnostic tool for legal reasoning.  It ensures that all structural prerequisites for legal effects are satisfied.  The chain consists of:

1. Source of Authority – Generically dependent continuant
2. Jurisdictional Scope – Relational dependent continuant
3. Role Conferral – Specifically dependent continuant (Role)
4. Normative Content – Realisable dependent continuant
5. Authorised Process – Process
6. Legal Event – Occurrent
7. Recognition / Recording – Realisable dependent continuant
8. Remedy / Repair – Disposition / Process

Refer to the colour‑coded diagram (MLC‑BFO) for visual guidance.

## Lecture Outline

1. **Structural vs doctrinal reasoning.**  Introduce the concept of structural legality.
2. **Detailed walk‑through of each MLC link.**  Define, provide examples, and map to BFO.
3. **Case studies.**  Work through simple scenarios (e.g., unlicensed surgeon, unauthorised contract).
4. **Group exercise.**  Students identify MLC links and potential failures in a hypothetical case.
5. **Summary and Q&A.**

## Activities

- **Quick Identification:** Present students with a series of facts and ask them to identify which MLC link is implicated.
- **Diagram Labeling:** Provide unlabeled versions of the MLC diagram and have students label each link.
- **Role Play:** Assign students different roles (authority, actor, institution) and simulate a process; observe which links break.
