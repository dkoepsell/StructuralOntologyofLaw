# Teaching Module: Contradiction Typology

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

- Understand the 13 types of structural contradictions.
- Map structural failures to corresponding MLC links and BFO violations.
- Apply the contradiction typology to diagnose legal scenarios.

## Overview

After constructing the MLC, any missing or invalid link results in a structural failure, classified into one of 13 contradiction types.  These types are grouped into four AERR families: **Authority**, **Event/Process**, **Recognition**, and **Repair**.

## Lecture Outline

1. **Recap of MLC.**  Review the eight links.
2. **AERR Families.**  Introduce the four families and explain their focus areas.
3. **Detailed Typology.**  Walk through Types 1–13, giving definitions, BFO violations, MLC mappings and examples.
4. **Diagnostic Methods.**  Show how to use SHACL shapes or logic rules to detect contradictions.
5. **Case Study.**  Provide a complex scenario and ask students to classify the failures.
6. **Discussion.**  Reflect on institutionalised contradictions and systemic issues.

## Activities

- **Matching Exercise:** Provide descriptions of failures; students match them to contradiction types.
- **Group Diagnosis:** In small groups, students examine case files and produce a list of contradiction types with justification.

## Supplementary Materials

- Structural failure diagrams (`StructuralFailuresareOntFailures.png`, `OntoFailureExample.png`).
- Contradiction typology poster.
- SHACL and SWRL examples (Module 3).
