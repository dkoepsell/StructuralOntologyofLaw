# Teaching Module: Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) Basics

## Learning Objectives

Students will:

- Distinguish between continuants and occurrents in BFO.
- Understand dependent continuants (generically, specifically, realisable, relational).
- Recognise how BFO categories underpin the SOoL structural model.

## Overview

BFO is a top‑level ontology designed to support interoperability across domain ontologies【238216681118797†L6-L13】.  It divides entities into **continuants** (things that persist through time) and **occurrents** (processes unfolding in time).  It further distinguishes between independent continuants (objects) and dependent continuants (qualities, roles, dispositions).  These categories form the backbone of the SOoL kernel.

### Key Categories

- **Independent Continuant:** An entity that can exist on its own (e.g., a person, a court).  
- **Generically Dependent Continuant:** Depends on some bearer but can be manifested in multiple bearers (e.g., the English language, authority)【873523715407077†L155-L159】.  
- **Specifically Dependent Continuant:** Inheres in exactly one bearer (e.g., a particular licence).  Roles are in this category【516386639202089†L88-L97】.  
- **Realisable Dependent Continuant:** Can be realised under certain conditions (e.g., a doctor’s duty).  Norms and powers fall here.  
- **Relational Dependent Continuant:** A relation between two or more entities (e.g., jurisdiction binds an authority to a domain).  
- **Disposition:** A tendency to behave in a certain way when triggered (e.g., a remedy to enforce a judgement).  
- **Process (Occurrent):** An unfolding event or action (e.g., a trial).  

## Relevance to SOoL

SOoL uses BFO categories to type each MLC link.  Understanding BFO ensures that the ontology is internally consistent and interoperable with other domain ontologies.  For example:

- **Authority** → Generically dependent continuant.
- **Role** → Specifically dependent continuant.
- **Authorised Process** → Process (Occurrent).

## Activities

- **Categorise Entities:** Students classify a list of legal concepts (e.g., ‘judge’, ‘licence’, ‘trial’, ‘law’) into BFO categories.
- **Discussion:** How does BFO help avoid category mistakes (e.g., treating a process as an object)?
