# Offense Mapping Methodology

The Offense Mapping Dataset bridges doctrinal offences to structural violations in the SOoL framework.  The mapping process proceeds through the following steps:

1. **Identify Offence Definitions** – Use authoritative criminal codes, civil statutes and case law to define each offence (e.g., assault, theft, breach of contract).  Prefer official statutory definitions and leading case interpretations.

2. **Analyse Structural Elements** – For each offence, identify the structural components that must be present for the offence to be valid.  Determine which MLC links are implicated.  For example, assault requires that the actor hold a role (citizen) and that the action is unauthorised; theft implicates property rights and recognition of ownership.

3. **Classify Violation Classes** – Determine which structural violation class (Authority, Event/Process, Recognition, Repair) the offence corresponds to.  
   - **Authority Violations:** Offences such as impersonating an officer involve conferral or jurisdiction problems.  
   - **Event/Process Violations:** Offences like assault, murder or trespass involve unauthorised events or processes.  
   - **Recognition Violations:** Offences involving forged documents implicate failures of recognition.  
   - **Repair Violations:** Offences such as contempt of court may involve the failure to comply with remedial orders.

4. **Determine Chain Failure Cues** – Identify cues that indicate failure at a particular MLC link when investigating an offence.  For instance, absence of licence (role cue), out‑of‑jurisdiction activity (jurisdiction cue), absence of court recording (recognition cue).

5. **Assign Contradiction Types** – Map the violation to the corresponding contradiction type(s) from the typology in Module 3.  Some offences may involve multiple types (e.g., fraud can involve recognition failure and role contradiction).

6. **Document Sources** – Provide citations to statutes, case law or secondary sources that support the mapping.  Where possible, include a hyperlink or reference for transparency.

7. **Review and Update** – Legal doctrines evolve.  Periodically review the mapping against new legislation and case law.  Maintain version control to track changes.

## Jurisdictional Variations

Offence definitions and structural mappings vary by jurisdiction.  To extend the dataset:

1. Create a copy of the mapping for the new jurisdiction.  
2. Adjust definitions and cues to reflect local statutes.  
3. Consider additional offences unique to that jurisdiction.  
4. Update the `jurisdiction` field in the dataset to indicate applicability.  
5. Revalidate the mapping with local legal experts.
