# Mapping Contradiction Types to Analysis

When a structural failure is detected, the analysis section of the IRACplus write‑up should explicitly address the contradiction.  The following table maps each contradiction type to analytical techniques and questions.

| Type | Analytical Focus | Guiding Questions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type 1: Conferral Failure** | Authority | Is there a valid source of authority?  Does the relevant statute or constitution empower the actor/institution? |
| **Type 2: Jurisdictional Contradiction** | Scope | Does the actor operate within the spatial, temporal and subject‑matter jurisdiction?  Are there conflicts of laws? |
| **Type 3: Role Contradiction** | Role Validity | Does the person occupy the required role?  Has a licence or appointment been properly conferred? |
| **Type 4: Procedural Contradiction** | Process Compliance | Were prescribed procedures followed?  Are there procedural safeguards that were ignored? |
| **Type 5: Temporal Contradiction** | Timing | Was the action taken while the norm was in force?  Have deadlines or limitation periods expired? |
| **Type 6: Recognition Failure** | Institutional Acknowledgment | Has a competent authority recognised the event?  Were filing or proclamation requirements met? |
| **Type 7: Correlativity Contradiction** | Relational Completeness | Are all parties or correlates to the norm present?  Are duties matched with rights? |
| **Type 8: Repair Failure** | Remedy Availability | Is there an available remedy?  What mechanisms exist to cure the defect? |
| **Type 9: Recognition Repair Failure** | Remedy Recognition | Has the remedy been acknowledged by the institution? |
| **Type 10: Procedural Repair Failure** | Remedy Process | Were procedural steps for the remedy followed? |
| **Type 11: Jurisdictional Repair Failure** | Remedy Jurisdiction | Does the remedial body have jurisdiction? |
| **Type 12: Compound Contradiction** | Multiple Failures | Which failures co‑occur?  How do they interact?  Does one failure cure another? |
| **Type 13: Institutionalised Contradiction** | Systemic Issues | Is the system tolerating structural failure?  Are exceptions entrenched? |

Addressing these questions in the analysis section ensures that structural failures are not overlooked and that remedies are appropriately considered.
