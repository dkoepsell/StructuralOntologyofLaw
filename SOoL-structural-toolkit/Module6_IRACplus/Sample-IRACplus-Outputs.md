## Example 1 – Valid Contract Formation

**Facts:**  A properly authorised employee of Company X signs a contract with Supplier Y for delivery of goods.  The contract is signed within the company’s jurisdiction and all required procedures (board approval, signature by authorised agent) are satisfied.  The contract is filed with the registrar.  No defects arise.

**Issue:**  Whether the contract between Company X and Supplier Y is legally binding.

**Rule:**  Under the Commercial Code, a contract is binding if entered into by a duly authorised agent acting within their authority and in compliance with formalities.

**Analysis:**  
1. **Source of Authority:** Company X’s board has authority to authorise contracts; the board resolution confers authority on the employee.  
2. **Jurisdictional Scope:** The contract pertains to Company X’s business and is executed within its subject‑matter jurisdiction.  
3. **Role Conferral:** The employee holds the role of purchasing manager, confirmed by written delegation.  
4. **Normative Content:** The Commercial Code prescribes how contracts are formed.  
5. **Authorised Process:** The employee followed required internal procedures, including obtaining board approval.  
6. **Legal Event:** Signing the contract constitutes the legal event of contract formation.  
7. **Recognition:** The contract was recorded with the registrar.  
8. **Remedy:** Remedies (damages, specific performance) exist if breach occurs.  

No MLC link fails.  Therefore, there is no structural contradiction.

**Conclusion:** The contract is legally binding.  

**Structural Diagnosis:** None (complete chain).

## Example 2 – Unlicensed Surgeon

**Facts:**  An individual performs surgery on a patient without holding a valid medical licence.  The patient consents, but the person has never been authorised as a physician and no licence exists.

**Issue:**  Whether a person without a medical licence can create a valid consent to surgery.

**Rule:**  The Medical Practice Act requires that only licensed physicians may perform surgery; consent to treatment is valid only when provided by a licensed practitioner.

**Analysis:**  
1. **Source of Authority:** The licensing board has authority to confer licences, but no licence has been issued to the actor.  
2. **Jurisdictional Scope:** The surgery occurs within the jurisdiction of the licensing board, but the actor lacks authorisation.  
3. **Role Conferral:** The actor does not hold the role of licensed physician.  
4. **Normative Content:** The norm requires that only licensed physicians may perform surgery.  
5. **Authorised Process:** The actor performed surgery without following any licensed procedure.  
6. **Legal Event:** The surgery took place.  
7. **Recognition:** There is no institutional recognition of the actor as a surgeon.  
8. **Remedy:** Patients may sue for malpractice; regulatory bodies may prosecute for unauthorized practice.

The chain fails at the **Role Conferral** link: the actor does not have the licensed‑physician role.  This failure is a **Type 3 Role Contradiction**.  It also implicates Type 1 (no authority) if the licensing board did not confer authority.  Because multiple failures occur, a **Type 12 Compound Contradiction** applies.

**Conclusion:** The consent is invalid; the surgery constitutes unauthorized practice of medicine.  

**Structural Diagnosis:** ["Type 3: Role Contradiction", "Type 12: Compound Contradiction"]
