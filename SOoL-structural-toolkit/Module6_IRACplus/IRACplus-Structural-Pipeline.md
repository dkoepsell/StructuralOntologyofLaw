# IRACplus Structural Pipeline

**IRACplus** integrates the structural insights of SOoL into the well‑known IRAC legal writing framework.  Each section is anchored to the Minimum Legal Chain (MLC) and the Contradiction Typology.

The pipeline from facts to writing proceeds as follows:

1. **Ontology** – Identify agents, roles, norms and institutions relevant to the problem.  Populate the structural elements of the case.
2. **MLC Construction** – Assemble the eight links of the Minimum Legal Chain for the problem.  Note which links are present and valid.
3. **Contradiction Diagnosis** – If any link is missing or invalid, classify the failure into one of the 13 contradiction types.
4. **IRACplus Composition** – Write the legal analysis, with explicit reference to structural elements:
   - **Issue** – Express the question in structural terms (e.g., “Whether a doctor without a licence can create a valid consent to surgery”).
   - **Rule** – State the normative content and authority (e.g., statutes requiring licensure) and identify which MLC links they correspond to.
   - **Analysis** – Apply the rule to the facts by checking each MLC link; discuss contradictions if present.
   - **Conclusion** – Conclude whether the legal effect exists and, if not, which structural failures prevent it.
   - **Structural Diagnosis** – Add a header or footnote summarising the contradiction type(s) and AERR family.

IRACplus ensures that legal writing is grounded in structure, reducing omissions and improving clarity.
